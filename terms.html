    <h1>TrackPulse Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="effective">Effective Date: February 25, 2026 | Last Updated: February 25, 2026</p>

    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of TrackPulse, a Gmail™ add-on developed by Stella Sourcing LLC ("we," "us," or "our"). By installing or using TrackPulse, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not install or use the Service.</p>

    <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>TrackPulse is a shipment tracking tool that automatically extracts air waybill (AWB) and tracking numbers from your Gmail™ inbox and provides real-time status updates from carriers worldwide. The Service operates as a Google Workspace™ add-on and runs within Google's infrastructure.</p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>TrackPulse is designed for business use by professionals in textile sourcing, fashion, and related industries. You must be at least 18 years old and have a valid Google Workspace™ or Gmail™ account to use the Service. By using TrackPulse, you represent that you have the authority to bind your organization to these Terms if you are using the Service on behalf of a business.</p>

    <h2>3. Account and Access</h2>
    <p>TrackPulse requires you to grant certain Google OAuth permissions as described in our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Google account and any API keys you configure within TrackPulse (such as 17Track API keys and Slack webhook URLs). You are responsible for all activity that occurs through your TrackPulse installation.</p>

    <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree to use TrackPulse only for its intended purpose of shipment tracking. You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract the source code of TrackPulse beyond what is visible in the Google Apps Script editor.</li>
      <li>Use TrackPulse to process, store, or transmit data in violation of any applicable law or regulation.</li>
      <li>Attempt to access other users' data or interfere with the Service's operation.</li>
      <li>Use TrackPulse for any purpose other than legitimate shipment tracking.</li>
      <li>Resell, redistribute, or sublicense access to TrackPulse without our written permission.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>TrackPulse integrates with third-party services including 17Track (for carrier tracking data) and Slack (for optional notifications). Your use of these third-party services is subject to their respective terms of service and privacy policies. We are not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or content provided by third-party services. Carrier tracking data is provided by 17Track and individual shipping carriers; we do not guarantee the accuracy or timeliness of tracking information.</p>

    <h2>6. Data and Privacy</h2>
    <p>Your privacy is important to us. Please review our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details on how we access, use, store, and protect your data. Our use of Google user data complies with the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>

    <h2>7. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>TrackPulse, including its design, code, and branding, is the property of Stella Sourcing LLC. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use TrackPulse for its intended purpose. This license does not grant you any rights to our trademarks, logos, or other intellectual property.</p>

    <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>TrackPulse is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or that tracking data will be accurate or complete. Shipment tracking data is sourced from third-party carriers and services; we are not responsible for inaccuracies in carrier-provided data.</p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Stella Sourcing LLC shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses resulting from your use of or inability to use the Service. Our total liability for any claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service shall not exceed the amount you paid us for the Service in the twelve months preceding the claim, or $100, whichever is greater.</p>

    <h2>10. Modifications to the Service</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue TrackPulse (or any part thereof) at any time, with or without notice. We shall not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the Service.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify users of material changes through the add-on interface or via email. Your continued use of TrackPulse after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms. The "Last Updated" date at the top reflects the most recent revision.</p>

    <h2>12. Termination</h2>
    <p>You may stop using TrackPulse at any time by uninstalling the add-on. We may suspend or terminate your access to TrackPulse if you violate these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Service ceases immediately. You can clear all stored data using "Clear All Data" in Settings before uninstalling.</p>

    <h2>13. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes arising from these Terms or your use of TrackPulse shall be resolved in the courts of New York County, New York.</p>
